BCA - Final Year Project - Courier Management System

This software is mainly concerned with the functionalities of a courier management system.
Courier service would mainly involve services provided to a customer in relation to door-to-door transportation of time sensitive documents, goods or articles.
Never having worked on any MVC frameworks or with C# this was an entirely new experience for me. The basics were simple and yet quite different.
From things like hyperlinking and using stylesheets to connecting to the DB and performing actions like a web application should, it was quite an adventure.
I went from complaining about the complications of somewhat less modern technology to appreciating the differences.
